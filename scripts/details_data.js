				'Development causes a change to the natural flow of runoff on a site. Increasing the quantity of impervious surface reduces the amount of stormwater that infiltrates into the ground, decreases the amount absorbed and expired by plants (evapotranspiration), and increases the amount of surface runoff.',
				'Increased surface runoff typically leads to increases in the erosion of land surfaces, increased water temperatures and an increase in pollutants reaching surface waters. It can deposit sediment and pollutants into waterways and warm historically cold water streams. It also increases the quantity of water draining into waterbodies, which can cause channel erosion in streams and downstream flooding. Changes in flow, increased sedimentation, pollutants, water temperatures and loss of groundwater input can negatively impact aquatic life as native species are replaced with more pollutant tolerant, warm water species.',

Many of these features also provide some level of treatment of the runoff, filtering pollutants and cooling runoff water before reaching the receiving waterway, maintaining or restoring groundwater input to the waterway.
